### DNA Adenine Methyltransferase Identification (DamID) Data Analysis Pipeline

DNA Adenine Methyltransferase Identification (DamID) is a technique used to identify protein-DNA interactions by fusing a DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) to a protein of interest, resulting in methylation of DNA at protein binding sites. This pipeline will guide you through the analysis of DamID data, including quality control, read trimming, alignment, filtering, peak calling, and visualization.

# DamID Data Analysis Pipeline

This pipeline provides a step-by-step workflow for processing and analyzing DNA Adenine Methyltransferase Identification (DamID) data. It includes quality control, read trimming, alignment, filtering, peak calling, and visualization.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed and accessible in your `PATH`:

- FastQC
- Trimmomatic
- BWA
- SAMtools
- Picard
- MACS2
- R (with relevant packages for visualization)
- Python 3

You also need a reference genome and associated files.

## Directory Structure

- `raw_data`: Directory containing raw FASTQ files.
- `trimmed_data`: Directory for storing trimmed reads.
- `alignments`: Directory for storing aligned BAM files.
- `filtered`: Directory for storing filtered BAM files.
- `peaks`: Directory for storing peak calling results.
- `visualization`: Directory for storing visualization outputs.

## Usage

1. **Set Up the Directories**:
    Ensure the necessary directories exist or create them:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p raw_data trimmed_data alignments filtered peaks visualization
    ```

2. **Prepare Reference Genome**:
    Ensure the reference genome file (`reference_genome.fa`) and related files are available.

3. **Run the Script**:
    Save the pipeline script as `damid_analysis_pipeline.sh` and make it executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x damid_analysis_pipeline.sh
    ./damid_analysis_pipeline.sh
    ```

## Script Breakdown

### Step 1: Quality Control

Run `FastQC` on raw FASTQ files to generate quality reports.

### Step 2: Read Trimming

Use `Trimmomatic` to remove adapter sequences and low-quality bases from the reads.

### Step 3: Alignment

Align trimmed reads to the reference genome using `BWA`.

### Step 4: Filtering

Filter out low-quality alignments and duplicates using `SAMtools` and `Picard`.

### Step 5: Peak Calling

Call peaks using `MACS2`.

### Step 6: Visualization

Visualize the peaks and alignment data using `R` and other visualization tools.

## Notes

- Modify the paths and parameters in the script as needed.
- Ensure all input files (e.g., FASTQ files, reference genome) are correctly specified.
- The pipeline assumes single-end DamID data; for paired-end data, adjustments might be needed.
